      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction: Why Consistent Sales Meetings Matter</h2>

      <p>
        Reviews don't capture themselves. Your team needs consistent reinforcement, celebration, coaching, and
        accountability.
      </p>

      <p>Most managers know they SHOULD talk about reviews in team meetings—but they don't know:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>What to say</li>
        <li>How long to spend on it</li>
        <li>How to make it engaging (not just a lecture)</li>
        <li>How to balance celebration with accountability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This document solves that problem.</p>

      <p>
        It gives you 12 ready-to-use sales meeting agendas (one for each week of the first 90 days) that integrate
        review capture into your weekly sales rhythm—plus a maintenance mode agenda for Weeks 13 and beyond.

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Each agenda includes:</div>

      <h2 class="section-header">How to Use This Document</h2>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li><strong>Weeks 1–4:</strong> Longer meetings (15–60 minutes) to train, practice, and build the habit.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weeks 5–12:</strong> Shorter check-ins (5–15 minutes) to celebrate wins, troubleshoot bottlenecks, and
          maintain momentum.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weeks 13+:</strong> Maintenance mode (5–10 minutes/week) to keep the habit alive without
          over-managing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can run these as standalone "review meetings" OR (better yet) integrate them into your existing weekly sales
        meetings (recommended—it shows reviews are part of the sales process, not a separate initiative).

        <div class="script-box">
          "Alright team, we're launching a new system to capture more Google reviews. Here's why this matters—and why
          it's worth your time. Right now, we're spending [$X per month] on marketing. Most of those leads are
          cold—they've never heard of us, they're shopping price, and they're skeptical. That makes your job harder.
          Meanwhile, our competitors with 200+ reviews are getting leads for free—and those leads already trust them
          before they even call. Here's the data—and this is real, proven data from a high-performing flooring dealer
          who implemented this exact system: • Digital leads tripled when they started capturing reviews consistently. •
          70% of their phone calls came from their Google Business Profile—not paid ads. • Total lead volume increased
          30–40% during review-active months (typically building toward this level over 6-12 months as the review count reaches critical mass). This isn't theory. This is what happens when you
          build a review-first marketing engine. And here's the thing: this isn't just about marketing. It's about
          culture, morale, and attracting top talent. When we have 300+ five-star reviews, we become the company
          everyone wants to work for—and the company every customer wants to hire. But here's the hidden benefit most
          people don't talk about: This system saves us time and mental energy. When we have a strong review presence: •
          We're not chasing down cold leads or babysitting skeptical customers through 8 follow-ups. • We're not
          constantly deciding which marketing channel to bet on next (Facebook? Google? Mailers? Billboards?). • We're
          not burning 192–252 hours per year managing 20+ marketing channels. That's 18–32 work days per year we get
          back. We can use that time to train the team, improve operations, or just breathe. And for those of you on
          commission: more reviews = more warm leads = easier sales = higher commissions. Every review you capture makes
          your job easier and your paycheck bigger. So this isn't just good for the company. It's good for you."

        <div class="agenda-header">2. Introduce the 4-Step Process (20 minutes)</div>
        <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
        <div class="script-box">
          "Okay, so how do we actually capture reviews? It's simple. There are four steps—and the whole thing takes less
          than 3 minutes per customer. Here's the process:

          <strong>Step 1: Plant the seed (during the sale)</strong>
          During or at the end of the sales consultation, say: 'By the way, one of the ways we've grown is through word
          of mouth and online reviews. If we do a great job for you—and I'm confident we will—I'll ask you to leave us a
          quick review on Google. Fair enough?' Time investment: 10 seconds.

          <strong>Step 2: Post-installation call (24–48 hours after the job)</strong>
          Call the customer 24–48 hours after installation to check in and make sure everything went smoothly. Why?
          Because not all unhappy customers complain. Some will smile, say everything's fine, and then quietly decide
          never to refer you—or worse, leave a bad review months later. We call this 'Silent Death.' The
          post-installation call prevents Silent Death. You're catching small issues early and fixing them before they
          turn into big problems. Here's the script: 'Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm just
          calling to check in and make sure everything went smoothly with your installation. How's the floor looking?
          Any questions or concerns I can help with?' If everything's great: 'That's great to hear! I'm so glad we could
          take care of you. Now, I know you're probably busy, but if you have a minute this week, I'd really appreciate
          it if you could leave us a quick review on Google. It helps us out a ton and helps other people feel confident
          choosing us. I'm going to text you a link right now so it's easy—does that work?' If there's a small issue:
          'Thanks so much for letting me know. I'm going to get that taken care of right away. Let me call you back once
          it's fixed, and then I'll send you that review link. Sound good?' Time investment: 2 minutes.

          <strong>Step 3: Text the link immediately (while you're still on the phone)</strong>
          Don't wait. Don't say 'I'll send it later.' Send the text while you're talking to them. Text template: 'Hi
          [Customer Name], thanks again for choosing us! Here's the link to leave your review: [Google Review Link].
          It'll only take a minute, and it really helps us out. We appreciate you!' Time investment: 30 seconds.

          <strong>Step 4: Follow up (3–5 days later if they haven't left a review)</strong>
          Life gets busy. People forget. A friendly reminder is not pushy—it's helpful. Follow-up text: 'Hi [Customer
          Name], just checking in—did the link I sent work okay? I know things get busy, but if you get a chance, we'd
          love that review! Here's the link again: [link]. Thanks!' Time investment: 30 seconds. Total time per
          customer: 3 minutes, 10 seconds. That's less time than it takes to follow up on a cold lead three times. And
          every review you capture brings us more warm leads next month. Now, I'm going to hand out the scripts. You'll
          have them at your desk so you can reference them anytime you need." [Hand out laminated scripts or binders
          with the Review Capture Scripts file.]

        <div class="script-box">
          "Okay, so here's what's in it for you—directly. Starting today, you'll earn $15 for every verified Google
          review you capture. That gets added to your paycheck every two weeks. If you capture 10 reviews a month,
          that's an extra $150. Over a year, that's $1,800. And here's the bigger picture: more reviews = more warm
          leads = easier sales = higher commissions. So you're not just earning $15 per review—you're investing in your
          future income. We're also running a monthly contest: Whoever captures the most reviews each month wins a $100
          gift card (or cash—your choice). We're going to track this on a leaderboard [point to whiteboard or show
          digital dashboard]. I'll update it every week. You'll be able to see exactly where you stand. And every week,
          we're going to celebrate wins publicly. When you capture a great review, I'm going to read it out loud at the
          team meeting and thank you by name. This isn't just about the money—it's about recognition and pride in the
          work you do. Does that sound fair?" [Let them respond. Get verbal agreement.]

      <div class="agenda-item">
        <div class="agenda-header">4. Address Objections (10 minutes)</div>
        <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
        <div class="script-box">
          "Okay, I know some of you might be thinking: 'What if the customer says no?' or 'What if I get a bad review?'
          or 'I'm too busy.' Let me address those right now.

          <strong>Objection #1: 'I don't want to be pushy.'</strong>
          You're not being pushy. You're giving the customer an opportunity to help the next family who's trying to
          decide where to go. That's not pushy—that's generous. And here's the reality: most customers are happy to
          leave a review. They're just waiting for someone to ask.

          <strong>Objection #2: 'What if we get a negative review?'</strong>
          The post-installation call is your insurance policy against bad reviews. When you call 24–48 hours after the
          job, you're catching small issues early and fixing them before they turn into big problems. And here's the
          thing: the best defense against a bad review is volume. If you have 150 five-star reviews and one two-star,
          nobody cares. But if you only have 20 reviews total, one bad one kills you.

          <strong>Objection #3: 'I'm too busy.'</strong>
          I get it. But the post-installation call takes 2 minutes. The text takes 30 seconds. That's less time than it
          takes to follow up on a cold lead three times. And every review you capture brings us more warm leads next
          month—which makes your job easier. So you're not too busy. You're investing 3 minutes now to save yourself
          hours later. Does anyone else have concerns or questions?" [Let them ask questions. Use the scripts from the
          Overcoming Barriers file to address any additional objections.]

          But here's the thing: most customers who say no just need a softer ask. Try the 'pay it forward' framing:
          'When you leave a review, you're helping the next family who's trying to decide where to go—kind of like

          optional. Making the post-installation call and asking for reviews is part of the job—just like making sales
          calls and writing quotes. If you're struggling with the script, I want to help. Come see me this week and
          we'll practice it together. If you're forgetting to make the call, set a daily reminder on your phone. Do it
          first thing every morning. And if you're not bought in yet, I need to know why. Because this system works—but
          only if everyone's on board. So here's the deal: starting this week, I'm going to check in with each of you
          individually. I want to know where you stand, what's hard, and how I can help. But I also need you to commit.
          Can I count on you to do this?" [Get verbal agreement from the team.]

          map pack. • Our lead volume: [X]% of our leads now come from organic Google (up from [Y]%). • Our total lead
          volume: We're getting [X]% more leads than we were 90 days ago. • Our marketing spend: We've reduced our
          monthly ad spend by $[X] (or reallocated it to higher-ROI channels). And here's the kicker: the leads we're
          getting from Google are warmer, easier to close, and less price-focused than paid ad leads. That means: •
          Higher close rates • Higher average tickets • Less time wasted on tire-kickers So this isn't just about the
          reviews. It's about building a business that works smarter—not harder. And for those of you on commission:
          every warm lead we get from Google is a lead you didn't have to chase. That's easier sales and bigger
