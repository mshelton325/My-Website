        The basic review capture scripts (in the Review Capture Scripts file) work 90% of the time and cover the most
        common customer objections.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document is for the other 10%—the tricky situations that require more nuance, and the training exercises
        you'll use to build your team's confidence.

      <h2 class="section-header">Part 1: Advanced Customer Scripts</h2>

      <p>
        These are detailed, word-for-word scripts for specific situations that are NOT covered in the basic Review
        Capture Scripts file.
      </p>

      <div class="scenario-header">SCENARIO 1: THE CUSTOMER WHO MENTIONS A COMPETITOR'S LOWER PRICE</div>

      <div class="context-label">Context:</div>
      <p>
        During the sales consultation, the customer says, "Your price is higher than [Competitor]." You want to use
        reviews to justify the price difference.
      </p>

      <div class="script-label">Script:</div>
      <div class="script-box">
        "I totally get it—you want to make sure you're making the right choice. Here's the thing: we're not the
        cheapest, and we're not trying to be. But we are the best value. And here's how you know: we have over 200
        Google reviews with a 4.9-star rating. [Competitor] has 40 reviews and a 4.2-star rating. Our customers are
        telling you something—they're saying we do what we promise, we show up on time, and we make the process smooth.
        That's worth a few extra dollars, especially when you're living with this floor for the next 15 years. You're
        not just buying a floor—you're buying peace of mind." [Pause and let them think] "I'd encourage you to read a
        few of our reviews and compare them to [Competitor]'s. I think you'll see the difference."
      </div>

      <div class="why-works-label">Why this works:</div>
      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>You're not being defensive about price.</li>
        <li>You're reframing the conversation from "cheapest" to "best value."</li>

      <h2 class="section-header">Part 2: Manager Coaching Scripts</h2>

      <p>These are scripts for managers to use when coaching team members who are struggling to ask for reviews.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> For scripts to address customer objections during the post-installation call, see the
        Review Capture Scripts – Manager Edition file (Script 8: Handling Internal Team Objections). The scripts below
        focus on 1-on-1 coaching conversations with individual team members.

      <div class="context-label">Context:</div>

      <div class="script-label">Script:</div>
      <div class="coaching-box">
        "I get it. But here's the thing: you're not being pushy. You're giving the customer an opportunity to help the
        next family who's trying to decide where to go. That's not pushy—that's generous. And here's the reality: if we
        don't ask, we don't get. And if we don't get reviews, we spend more money on ads, which means less money for
        raises, bonuses, and benefits. So asking for reviews isn't just good for the company—it's good for you. Let's
        practice the script together so it feels more natural. I'll be the customer. You call me and ask how the install
        went. Go."

      <div class="scenario-header">SCENARIO 3: A SALESPERSON SAYS "WHAT IF THEY LEAVE A BAD REVIEW?"</div>

      <div class="context-label">Context:</div>
      <p>
        One of your salespeople is afraid to ask for reviews because they're worried the customer will leave a negative
        review.
      </p>

      <div class="script-label">Script:</div>
      <div class="coaching-box">
        "That's a valid concern. But here's the reality: the post-installation call is your insurance policy against bad
        reviews. When you call the customer 24–48 hours after the job, you're catching small issues early and fixing
        them before they turn into big problems. And here's the thing: most customers are happy. They're just waiting
        for someone to ask them to leave a review. Plus, the best defense against a bad review is volume. If you have
        150 five-star reviews and one two-star review, nobody cares about the two-star review. But if you only have 20
        reviews total, one bad one kills you. So the question isn't 'What if we get a bad review?' The question is 'What
        if we don't ask and we stay stuck at 20 reviews while our competitor climbs to 200?'"
      </div>

      <div class="why-works-label">Why this works:</div>
      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>You're addressing their fear directly (not dismissing it).</li>
        <li>You're showing them how the post-installation call prevents bad reviews.</li>
        <li>You're reframing the risk (staying stuck is worse than getting one bad review).</li>

      <div class="context-label">Context:</div>

      <div class="script-label">Script:</div>
      <div class="coaching-box">
        "I hear you. But here's the thing: the post-installation call takes 2 minutes. The text takes 30 seconds. That's
        less time than it takes to follow up on a cold lead three times. And every review you capture brings us more
        warm leads next month—which makes your job easier. So you're not too busy. You're investing 3 minutes now to
        save yourself hours later. Let's make it automatic. Set a reminder on your phone for 24 hours after every
        install. That way, you won't forget. And if you're really slammed, I can help you make a few of the calls this
        week. Sound good?"

          If the customer hesitates, reframe the ask as 'paying it forward' and offer no pressure. • If you fixed a
          problem, ask for a review—it shows you stand behind your work. Alright, let's go out there and capture some
          reviews this week. Who's with me?"
