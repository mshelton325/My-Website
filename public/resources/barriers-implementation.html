      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction</h2>

      <p>The system is simple. The scripts work. The ROI is undeniable.</p>

      <p>So why don't teams consistently ask for reviews?</p>

      <p>Because asking for reviews feels uncomfortable—even when you know it works.</p>

      <p>
        This document addresses the 14 most common barriers that prevent sales teams from asking for reviews
        consistently—and gives you (the manager) specific scripts, tools, and strategies to overcome each one.

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Use this as your troubleshooting guide when someone on your team says:</div>

      <h2 class="section-header">The 14 Barriers (And How to Fix Them)</h2>

      <div class="barrier-header">BARRIER #1: "I DON'T WANT TO BE PUSHY"</div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">What the salesperson says:</div>
        <p>
          "I don't want to bother the customer. They just spent a lot of money with us. It feels pushy to ask for
          something else."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">Root cause:</div>
        <p>
          The salesperson thinks asking for a review is asking for a favor—when in reality, it's offering the customer a
          platform to share their experience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">The fix:</div>
        <p>Reframe the ask as helping future customers, not helping yourself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Script (for managers to use with the team):</div>
        <p>
          "I get it. You don't want to be pushy. But here's the thing: when you ask for a review, you're not asking the
          customer to do you a favor. You're giving them a platform to help other people like them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Johnson was stressed out before she called us. She didn't know which company to trust. She spent an hour
          reading reviews before she picked up the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that she's happy with her floors, don't you think she'd want to help the next person who's in her shoes?
        </p>
        <p>You're not being pushy. You're offering her a way to pay it forward. That's the frame. Try it."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the "Pay It Forward" text template from the Review Capture Scripts file. It
          reframes the ask as helping other customers, not promoting yourself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-header">BARRIER #2: "WHAT IF THEY LEAVE A BAD REVIEW?"</div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">What the salesperson says:</div>
        <p>"What if I ask for a review and they leave a 1-star review? I'd rather not ask at all."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">Root cause:</div>
        <p>
          Fear of negative feedback. The salesperson is worried they'll trigger a bad review that wouldn't have happened
          otherwise.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">The fix:</div>
        <p>Explain that the post-installation call prevents bad reviews—it doesn't cause them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Script (for managers to use with the team):</div>
        <p>
          "Let me ask you this: if a customer is unhappy, do you think ignoring them will make them less likely to leave
          a bad review?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what actually happens: unhappy customers who don't get a follow-up call are MORE likely to leave a bad
          review—because they feel ignored.
        </p>
        <p>The post-installation call does two things:</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>It catches small issues early (before they turn into big problems).</li>
          <li>It shows the customer you care enough to follow up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there's a problem, you fix it. If everything went well, you ask for the review.</p>
        <p>
          Either way, you're ahead. The customers who are going to leave a bad review were going to do it anyway—you're
          just getting in front of it now."

        <p>"I don't have time to call every customer after the install. I'm already swamped."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">Root cause:</div>
        <p>The salesperson doesn't see review capture as part of their job—they see it as extra work.</p>

        <div class="barrier-label">The fix:</div>
        <p>
          Show them the time investment (3 minutes per customer) and the financial payoff (warmer leads = easier sales =
          less grinding).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Script (for managers to use with the team):</div>
        <p>"I hear you. You're busy. But let's talk about what 'busy' actually means.</p>
        <p>
          Right now, you're spending 8–10 hours a week chasing cold leads, doing multiple follow-ups, and convincing
          skeptical customers to trust us. That's exhausting.
        </p>
        <p>What if I told you that for 3 minutes per customer—literally 3 minutes—you could cut that grind in half?</p>
        <p>Here's the math:</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Post-installation call: 2 minutes</li>
          <li>Text the review link: 30 seconds</li>
          <li>Follow-up text: 30 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Total: 3 minutes, 10 seconds</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do 10 jobs per month, that's 30 minutes of your time.</p>
        <p>
          In exchange, you get warmer leads next month—leads who already trust us because they read your reviews. Those
          leads are easier to sell, they close faster, and they pay more.
        </p>
        <p>So yes, you're 'busy.' But you're busy with the wrong things. Let's fix that."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Block 15 minutes at the end of each day for post-installation calls. Treat it like a
          mandatory task—not an optional one.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-header">BARRIER #4: "THE CUSTOMER ALREADY SEEMS ANNOYED—I DON'T WANT TO PUSH IT"</div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">What the salesperson says:</div>
        <p>"The customer seemed stressed during the consultation. I don't want to bother them again."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">Root cause:</div>
        <p>
          The salesperson is interpreting normal customer stress as dissatisfaction with the company—when in reality,
          the customer is just overwhelmed by the decision.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="barrier-element">
        <div class="barrier-label">The fix:</div>

        <div class="callout-header">Script (for managers to use with the team):</div>
        <p>
          "Here's what you're missing: the customer isn't annoyed with you. They're stressed because flooring is a big
          decision and they're worried something will go wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you call them 24–48 hours after the install and say, 'Hey, I just wanted to check in—how did everything
          go?'—that's not annoying. That's reassuring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most companies don't call. Most companies disappear after the install. When you follow up, you're proving that
          we're different.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here's the best part: if there IS a small issue, the customer is relieved that you asked—because now they
          don't have to figure out how to bring it up.
        </p>
        <p>You're not bothering them. You're giving them permission to be honest."</p>

          And here's how we're going to make it even more tangible: from now on, every time a customer mentions an

        <p>Here's the difference: we're not just 'asking for reviews.' We're building a system.</p>

        <p>This isn't a campaign. It's a permanent part of how we do business.</p>
        <p>

          20 jobs per month, we should capture 8–12 reviews. Every month. That's 96–144 reviews per year.

      <p>Every team has objections. Every salesperson feels uncomfortable at first. That's normal.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Your job as the manager is to:</div>
        <ol>
          <li>Listen to the objection.</li>
          <li>Identify the root cause.</li>
          <li>Use the scripts and tools in this guide to address it.</li>
          <li>Hold people accountable.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>The review capture system works. The scripts work. The ROI is proven.</p>

      <p>The only variable is whether your team consistently follows the process.</p>

      <p>
        Use this guide to troubleshoot, coach, and support your team—and watch your review count (and your revenue)
        climb over the next 90 days.
