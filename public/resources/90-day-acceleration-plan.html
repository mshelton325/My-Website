      <h1 class="cover-title">90-DAY REVIEW ACCELERATION PLAN</h1>
      <div class="cover-subtitle">A Week-by-Week Roadmap for Managers to Build a Sustainable Review Capture System</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction: What This Plan Will Do</h2>

      <p>This is your complete, step-by-step roadmap for building a review-first marketing engine in 90 days.</p>

      <p>
        This plan is designed for store managers, sales managers, and owner-operators. If you're a sales manager, you
        may need to secure budget approval from your GM/Owner for incentives and cross-functional initiatives (installer
        cards, job folder stamps, etc.). Everything else is within your control.
      </p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">By the end of this plan, you will have:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>50–100+ new Google reviews (depending on your job volume)</li>
          <li>A higher star rating (e.g., 4.2 → 4.6 or 4.6 → 4.8)</li>
          <li>A repeatable system that captures reviews automatically, month after month</li>
          <li>A team that understands why reviews matter and how to ask for them consistently</li>
          <li>The foundation for lead growth (with initial increases in lead volume and quality, compounding over 6-12 months)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <strong>Time commitment:</strong><br>
        Weeks 1–2: 3–5 hours (setup and kickoff)<br>
        Weeks 3–12: 1–2 hours per week (monitoring, coaching, celebrating wins)
      </div>

      <p>Let's get started.</p>

      <div class="page-number">Page 1</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Set up systems, train your team, and capture your first 5–10 reviews.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">WEEK 1: SETUP &amp; KICKOFF</h3>
      <p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 3–5 hours total for manager</p>

      <h4><strong>Monday: Audit Your Current Google Business Profile (30 minutes)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Action items:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Go to Google and search for your business name + city</li>
          <li>
            Review your Google Business Profile: How many reviews do you have? What's your average star rating? When was
            your last review posted?
          </li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your current profile for comparison later</li>
          <li>Identify your 10 best reviews and save them in a document</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> You need a baseline so you can measure progress in 90 days.</p>

      <h4><strong>Tuesday: Generate Your Google Review Link (15 minutes)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Action items:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            Follow the instructions in the Review Request Text Templates file to generate your unique Google review link
          </li>
          <li>Test the link on your phone to make sure it works</li>
          <li>Save the link in a shared document (Google Doc, CRM, or team drive) where everyone can access it</li>
          <li>Optional: Shorten the link using Bitly or TinyURL for easier sharing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Your team can't request reviews if they don't have the link.</p>

      <h4><strong>Wednesday: Customize Scripts and Templates (1 hour)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Action items:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Review the Review Capture Scripts file</li>
          <li>Customize the scripts slightly to match your voice and company name</li>
          <li>
            Print or share the scripts with your team (post-installation call script, text templates, objection-handling
            scripts)
          </li>
          <li>Laminate the scripts or put them in a binder on every salesperson's desk</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't overthink this. The scripts are proven. You're just tweaking the wording
        slightly to sound like you.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Thursday: Set Up Tracking (1 hour)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Action items:</div>
        <p>Create a simple tracking system using one of these options:</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Option A (Low-Lift):</strong> A whiteboard in your sales office with columns for "Salesperson,"
            "Reviews This Week," "Reviews This Month," and "Total Reviews."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Option B (Deep-Dive):</strong> Use the Weekly Sales Meeting Dashboard Template file to create a
            digital leaderboard in Google Sheets or Excel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Set a baseline goal: "We will capture X reviews per week as a team."</p>
        <p>
          Example: If you complete 20 jobs per month and want a 50% capture rate, your goal is 10 reviews per month (or
          2–3 per week).
        </p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> If you don't track it, it won't get done.</p>

      <div class="page-number">Page 2</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h4><strong>Friday: Team Kickoff Meeting (1 hour)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Agenda:</div>

        <p><strong>1. Explain the "Why" (15 minutes)</strong></p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            Share the financial impact: "If we build our review presence to 150+ reviews, we can reduce our ad spend by
            $30,000–$70,000 per year."
          </li>
          <li>
            Show the data—digital leads tripled when reviews were captured consistently, 70% of phone calls came from
            the Google Business Profile, total lead volume increased 30–40% during review-active months.
          </li>
          <li>Show 2–3 great reviews from your existing profile and read them aloud</li>
          <li>
            Emphasize the compound benefit: "This isn't just about marketing. It's about culture, morale, and attracting
            top talent."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. The Hidden ROI: Time, Sanity, and Manager Income (5 minutes)</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Here's what most dealers don't talk about: this system doesn't just generate more leads—it saves you time and
          mental energy. When you build a strong review presence, you're not chasing down cold leads or babysitting
          skeptical customers through 8 follow-ups. That's 18–32 work days per year you get back. And for managers
          bonused on sales volume, you can increase your annual bonus by $14,000–$35,000 just by reallocating marketing
          spend into reviews and training."
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Introduce the Process (20 minutes)</strong></p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            Walk through the 4-step system: Plant the seed, Post-installation call, Text the link immediately, Follow up
          </li>
          <li>Hand out the scripts and text templates</li>
          <li>
            Emphasize the "Silent Death" concept: "Not all unhappy customers complain. Some just leave quietly—and maybe
            leave a bad review later. The post-installation call prevents that."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Launch the Incentive Program (10 minutes)</strong></p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Announce: "For every verified Google review you capture, you'll earn $15–$20."</li>
          <li>Explain how tracking works (leaderboard, weekly updates, paychecks)</li>
          <li>
            Optional: Announce a monthly contest: "Whoever captures the most reviews this month wins a $100 gift card."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>5. Address Concerns (10 minutes)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Let the team ask questions and answer their objections using the scripts in the Review Capture Scripts file.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6. Set the First Goal (5 minutes)</strong></p>
        <p>"Let's capture 5 reviews as a team this week. Who's in?"</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="sub-header">WEEK 2: FIRST WINS &amp; TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
      <p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 1–2 hours total for manager</p>

      <h4><strong>Monday–Friday: Monitor &amp; Support (15 minutes per day)</strong></h4>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Action items:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            Check your tracking system daily: Who's making post-installation calls? Who's capturing reviews? Who's
            struggling?
          </li>
          <li>
            Celebrate every win publicly: When someone captures a review, send a team-wide text or email: "Great job,
            Sarah! You captured 2 reviews this week!"
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify anyone who's struggling and offer 1-on-1 support: Pull them aside and ask: "What's hard about this?
            Do you need to practice the script?"
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The first two weeks are critical. Your team is building a new habit. If you
        don't monitor and support them, the habit won't stick.

            of every customer, and it's nice to know people feel good enough about us to share their experience."
          </li>
          <li>
            Teach them to send curated reviews in follow-up emails using the Review Library Template file to organize
            your best reviews by theme

          Physical business cards that your installers hand to customers at the end of the job, asking to be mentioned
          by name in the review.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong></p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>It personalizes the review request (customers feel connected to the installer, not just the company)</li>
          <li>It gives installers ownership and pride in their work</li>
          <li>It increases the likelihood that customers leave detailed, specific reviews</li>

        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            Design a simple business card with installer's name, photo (optional), "Please mention me by name in your

          </li>
          <li>Print 50–100 cards per installer (cheap via VistaPrint, Canva, or local print shop)</li>
          <li>Train installers to hand the card to the customer at the end of the job</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Explain the Concept (10 minutes):</strong> "Not all unhappy customers complain. Some will smile, say
            everything's fine, and then quietly decide never to refer you—or worse, leave a bad review months later.
            That's Silent Death."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emphasize the Punch List vs. Problem Distinction (5 minutes):</strong> "A punch list is a small
            issue you catch early and fix fast. The customer appreciates it. A problem is the same issue, ignored, that
            festers and turns into a bad review or lost referral."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Role-Play (10 minutes):</strong> Practice handling a customer who mentions a minor issue during the
            callback
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reinforce the Financial Impact (5 minutes):</strong> "Every review you capture brings us warmer
            leads next month. That means easier sales, higher tickets, and bigger commissions for you."

      <p>
        If you're a manager or owner bonused on sales volume (2–5% of revenue), here's a truth bomb: you'll make more
        money by spending less on marketing and investing in reviews.
      </p>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <strong>Scenario A: High Marketing Spend, Low Reviews</strong><br>
        Annual revenue: $2,500,000<br>
        Marketing spend: $110,000<br>
        Close rate: 30%<br>
        Average ticket: $6,000<br>
        Manager bonus (3% of revenue): $75,000
      </div>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <strong>Scenario B: Low Marketing Spend, Strong Reviews</strong><br>
        Annual revenue: $2,500,000 (same)<br>
        Marketing spend: $40,000 (cut by $70K)<br>
        Close rate: 50% (because leads trust you before they call)<br>
        Average ticket: $7,500 (because reviews justify premium pricing)<br>
        Manager bonus (3% of revenue): $75,000<br><br>
        <strong>In Scenario B, you're reallocating that $70K in savings into better training, installer incentives, and your
          own compensation. Result: You make $14,000–$35,000 more per year in total compensation—while working less,
          stressing less, and managing fewer marketing channels.</strong>

      <h2 class="section-header">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pitfall #1: Giving Up After a Slow Start</h3>
      <p>
        The first month is always the hardest. Your team is learning. Customers are hesitant. Momentum is low. Stick
        with it. By month two or three, it becomes second nature.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pitfall #2: Not Tracking Consistently</h3>
      <p>
        If you stop updating the leaderboard or celebrating wins, the team assumes it doesn't matter—and they stop doing
        it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pitfall #3: Not Making the Post-Installation Call</h3>
      <p>
        This is the most important step. If you skip it, your response rate will be much lower—and you'll miss "Silent
        Death" issues.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pitfall #4: Asking for Reviews on Multiple Platforms</h3>
      <p>Focus on Google first. Once you have 100+ Google reviews, then you can branch out to Facebook, Yelp, etc.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pitfall #5: Not Paying Out Incentives</h3>
      <p>If you announce a $15-per-review bonus and then don't pay it, your team will lose trust and stop asking.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion: You've Got the Roadmap—Now Execute</h2>

      <p>This 90-day plan is proven. It works. It's simple.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Your job is to:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Follow the roadmap week by week</li>

          <li>Track the results</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you do that, you'll have 50–100 new Google reviews in 90 days, a higher star rating, more organic leads, and
        a review-first marketing engine that runs on autopilot.
