      <h1 class="cover-title">REVIEW CAPTURE SCRIPTS – SALESPERSON EDITION</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This document contains the exact scripts you should use to capture Google reviews at every stage of the customer
        journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        These scripts have been tested, refined, and proven to work. Don't reinvent the wheel—use these scripts,
        practice them until they feel natural, and adjust the wording slightly to match your voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job is simple: plant the seed, make the post-installation call, send the text, and follow up once if
        needed. If you do that consistently, you'll capture reviews from 40–60% of your customers—and you'll see the
        results in your paycheck.
      </p>

      <div class="page-number">Page 1</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">SCRIPT 1: Planting the Seed (During the Initial Consultation)</h2>

      <p><strong>When to use:</strong> During or at the end of the sales consultation, before the customer signs.</p>

      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Set the expectation that you'll ask for a review later—so it's not a surprise.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Script:</h3>

      <div class="script-box">
        "By the way, one of the ways we've grown is through word of mouth and online reviews. If we do a great job for
        you—and I'm confident we will—I'll ask you to leave us a quick review on Google. Fair enough?"

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">SCRIPT 2: The Post-Installation Call (24–48 Hours After the Job)</h2>

      <p><strong>When to use:</strong> 24–48 hours after installation is complete.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Check for "Silent Death" issues (small problems the customer hasn't reported), fix
        them fast, and ask for the review while the positive experience is fresh.

      <h3 class="sub-header">Script (If Everything Went Well):</h3>

        </p>

        <p><em>[Customer says everything's great]</em></p>

        <p>
          "That's great to hear! I'm so glad we could take care of you. Now, I know you're probably busy, but if you
          have a minute this week, I'd REALLY appreciate it if you could leave us a quick review on Google. It helps us
          out a ton and helps other people feel confident choosing us. I'm going to text you a link right now so it's
          easy—does that work?"
        </p>

        <p><em>[Customer agrees]</em></p>

          want to catch early. I'm going to get that taken care of right away. Let me call you back once it's fixed, and
          then I'll send you that review link. Sound good?"

        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] again. Just wanted to let you know we took care of that [issue].
          Everything should be perfect now. If you're happy with how we handled it, I'd love it if you could leave us a

      <h2 class="section-header">SCRIPT 3: The Text Message (Sent Immediately After the Call)</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>When to use:</strong> Immediately after the post-installation call, while you're still on the phone or
        right after you hang up.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Get the review link into the customer's hands so there's no friction.</p>

          "That's great to hear. I'm really glad we could make it right. Now, if you're comfortable with it, I'd love it
          if you could leave us a review on Google. It helps other people know that if something does come up, we'll
          take care of it fast. I'm going to text you the link right now. Does that work?"

          <li>Customers often leave glowing reviews after you fix a problem—because it shows you care.</li>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Practice them out loud.</strong> Don't just read the scripts—role-play them until they feel natural.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjust the wording to match your voice.</strong> These scripts are proven, but you can tweak them
          slightly to sound like you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don't skip the post-installation call.</strong> This is the most important step. It prevents "Silent
          Death" and sets you up for a positive review.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Send the text immediately.</strong> Don't wait. Don't say "I'll send it later." Send it while you're
          on the phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow up once.</strong> If they don't leave a review within 3–5 days, send one friendly follow-up.
          After that, let it go.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celebrate every win.</strong> When someone leaves a review, thank them—and ask your manager to
          recognize it in team meetings. Positive reinforcement builds momentum.
        </li>
      </ul>
