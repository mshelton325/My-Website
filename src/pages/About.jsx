            The Turnaround Story
          </h2>
          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 space-y-6">
            <p>
              Matt took his family's flooring store from an overextended, burnout-prone operation—"running at 12 mph when the team could only handle 5"—to a disciplined, data-driven business that consistently beats industry averages in close rate, average ticket, and profitability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way, he reduced annual marketing spend from <strong>$110,000 (2010)</strong> to <strong>$40,000 (2025)</strong>—while growing sales by <strong>70%</strong>—by building a review-first marketing engine. Today, 70% of his inbound leads come from organic Google search (not paid ads), and his store maintains a <strong>4.9-star rating with 450+ reviews</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the numbers only tell part of the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real transformation happened when Matt stopped chasing volume and started building systems: systems for hiring and training salespeople with no flooring background, systems for capturing and leveraging customer reviews, systems for qualifying leads and protecting margins, and systems for holding manufacturers accountable when products don't perform as promised.
            </p>
            <p>
              He built a business that doesn't just generate revenue—it protects the time, energy, and integrity of everyone involved.

            The Mission: Prove That Ethics and Profitability Aren't Mutually Exclusive
          </h2>
          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 space-y-6">
            <p>
              Matt is out to prove something the flooring industry (and much of the business world) has forgotten:
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary-900">
              You can be wildly successful without gimmicks, high-pressure sales tactics, or taking advantage of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              He refuses to follow industry trends that prioritize short-term sales over long-term trust:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong>No bait-and-switch deals</strong> that lure customers in with fake discounts, only to upsell them on inflated products.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No "selling the sizzle"</strong>—vague, emotionally manipulative pitches that aren't backed by honest explanations of cost, durability, or real-world performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No hiding behind manufacturer fine print</strong> when a product fails. If a customer was sold a promise, Matt believes the dealer has a responsibility to make it right—even if the manufacturer won't.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              He's lost sales because of this approach. He's walked away from deals where the customer wanted him to cut corners, sell them the wrong product, or mislead them about timelines or warranties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>And he's proud of it.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Matt operates his business—and his life—with one guiding principle:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary-700 pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-white">
              <p className="text-2xl italic text-gray-900 font-medium">
                "Would I be proud to have full transparency in front of God and have Him be proud of what I've done and what I continue to stand for?"
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              That question drives every decision: how he trains his sales team, how he handles customer complaints, how he treats his installers, and how he advises his consulting clients.

                <p>
                  Most consultants overcomplicate things. Matt does the opposite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His systems are designed to be <strong>plug-and-play</strong>: clear scripts, step-by-step checklists, and practical tools that salespeople and managers can use immediately—without needing a PhD in business theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He believes that if a system isn't simple enough for a front-line employee to execute consistently, it's not a system—it's a burden.

                <p>
                  Matt trains salespeople to take the right path, not the path of least resistance.
                </p>
                <p>That means:</p>
                <ul className="space-y-2 ml-6">
                  <li>Asking the right questions to understand what the customer actually needs (not just what's easiest to sell).</li>
                  <li>Presenting options honestly—including the trade-offs, limitations, and long-term costs.</li>
                  <li>Walking away from sales that aren't in the customer's best interest, even if it hurts short-term revenue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  He's convinced that honesty is the ultimate competitive advantage. In a world full of bait-and-switch dealers, slick-talking salespeople, and manufacturers who dodge accountability, the company that tells the truth—and backs it up—wins in the long run.

                <ul className="space-y-2 ml-6">
                  <li><strong>Salespeople</strong> are accountable for asking for reviews, following up with customers, and qualifying leads properly (not just chasing volume).</li>
                  <li><strong>Managers</strong> are accountable for tracking performance, celebrating wins, and coaching team members who struggle.</li>
                  <li><strong>Manufacturers</strong> are accountable for standing behind their products when they fail—and if they won't, Matt teaches dealers how to hold them to it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Customers</strong> are accountable too: Matt doesn't chase tire-kickers or price-shoppers. He teaches dealers how to qualify leads early and invest their time in prospects who value quality and service.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>The result?</strong> Less chaos, less burnout, and more predictable, sustainable growth.

            </p>
            <p>
              He specializes in helping independent flooring dealers and regional chains:

              <li>
                <strong>Build sales training ecosystems</strong> with multi-phase training paths, scripts, objection-handling frameworks, and accountability systems that turn new hires—often with no flooring background—into reliable producers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Create operational systems</strong> that reduce mistakes, callbacks, and wasted time (quoting tools, lead qualification processes, job folder accountability, post-installation callback systems, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hold manufacturers accountable</strong> when products fail, using data, documentation, and leverage to protect dealers and their customers.

            </ul>

              His clients describe his work as <em>"finally having a system that makes sense"</em> and <em>"the first consultant who actually gets what it's like in the trenches."</em>

              Matt is convinced that the business world—and the world in general—can turn around through honesty, kindness, and respect for everyone: customers, executives, front-line staff, and everyone in between.
            </p>
            <p>
              He believes that:

            <ul className="space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Customers</strong> deserve to be treated with integrity, not manipulated with high-pressure tactics or misleading offers.</li>
              <li><strong>Salespeople</strong> deserve systems and training that make them successful, not vague advice like "just be confident" or "sell value."</li>
              <li><strong>Installers and support staff</strong> deserve recognition and respect for the critical work they do—even if they're not customer-facing.</li>
              <li><strong>Owners and managers</strong> deserve businesses that don't require 70-hour weeks and constant firefighting just to stay afloat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And he's building a consulting practice to prove it.

              Every system he creates, every manual he writes, every training session he runs is designed to show that you don't have to sacrifice your values to build a profitable, sustainable, high-performing business.
            </p>
            <p>
              You just have to be willing to lead by example, take the harder path, and trust that doing the right thing—consistently, over time—compounds into something far more valuable than any gimmick ever could.

              He's also using systems to create an ADHD-friendly, location-flexible lifestyle that allows him to work remotely, spend time near water (fishing, road trips, future conversion-van travel), and make space for deeper relationships, future family, and a pace of life that doesn't burn him out.
