        Part of the Review Leverage System<br>

      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction: Why This Matters to YOU</h2>

      <p>Let's talk about what you care about most: your paycheck.</p>

      <p>
        You probably think reviews are something the marketing department worries about. Or something the owner cares
        about because it makes the company look good.
      </p>

      <p>But here's the truth:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Google reviews are the single most powerful tool you have to make your job easier and your commissions
          bigger.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Here's why:</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">1. Reviews Bring You Warmer Leads</h3>

      <p>
        When someone searches "flooring near me" and sees your company's 4.9-star rating and 200+ reviews, they don't
        call five other places. They call you first.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when they walk in the door, they're not starting from zero. They already trust you. They've already read
        about your quality, your service, your installers.
      </p>

      <p>Translation: You spend less time convincing them and more time closing them.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">2. Warmer Leads = Higher Commissions</h3>

      <p>Warmer leads close faster. They're less price-sensitive. They buy more confidently.</p>

      <p>
        Cold leads (the ones from paid ads or random walk-ins) are skeptical. They want the cheapest price. They ghost
        you after three follow-ups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Warm leads (the ones who found you on Google and read your reviews) are ready to buy. They just need you to
        guide them through the process.
      </p>

      <p>Which leads would you rather work with?</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">3. More Reviews = More Leads (Which Means More Opportunities for You)</h3>

      <p>Here's the math:</p>

      <p>More reviews = higher Google ranking</p>
      <p>Higher Google ranking = more organic traffic</p>
      <p>More organic traffic = more inbound calls and showroom visits</p>
      <p>More inbound calls = more opportunities for you to sell</p>

      <p>Translation: Every review you capture feeds the pipeline that keeps your calendar full.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">4. You Can Build Your Own Personal Brand with Reviews</h3>

      <p>When customers mention you by name in a review, that's proof you're good at what you do.</p>

      <p>You can use those reviews to:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>Build credibility with new customers</li>
        <li>Stand out from other salespeople at your company</li>
        <li>Build a personal portfolio that follows you wherever you go</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Bottom line: Reviews aren't just good for the company. They're good for your career.</p>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">The Data: What Reviews Actually Do for Lead Flow (And Your Paycheck)</h2>

      <p>Let me show you some real numbers from our store.</p>

      <p>We pulled years of data to answer one question: Do reviews actually drive more leads?</p>

      <p>Here's what we found:</p>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <div class="callout-header">Finding #1: Digital leads tripled.</div>
        <p>
          During months when we earned reviews consistently, digital/web-influenced leads—the people who found us on
          Google, filled out a form, sent a text, or clicked through from our profile—tripled.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some of the warmest leads you'll ever get. They've already read reviews, looked at our star rating,
          and decided to reach out.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <div class="callout-header">Finding #2: Reviews drive phone calls, too—not just web leads.</div>
        <p>
          We use call tracking numbers in different places—one on our website, one on Google Ads, and one on our Google
          Business Profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we looked at all the inbound calls, 70%+ of our phone calls came from the number on our Google Business
          Profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me say that again: 70% of our phone leads came from people who were staring at our Google listing—and our
          reviews—when they decided to call.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stats-callout">
        <div class="callout-header">Finding #3: Total lead volume increased 30–40%.</div>
        <p>
          During months when we earned reviews consistently, total lead volume—across all sources—increased by 30–40%.
        </p>
        <p>And we know where that growth came from:</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Digital leads tripled</li>
          <li>70% of phone calls are tied to our Google profile (where reviews live)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Translation: Reviews don't just drive a few web forms. They drive digital leads, phone calls, and overall lead
          volume—across the board.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">What This Means for YOUR Paycheck:</div>
        <p>
          If you're not earning reviews consistently, you're leaving 30–40% of your potential lead volume on the table
          every single month.
        </p>
        <p>That's 30–40% fewer opportunities to sell.</p>
        <p>30–40% fewer chances to earn commissions.</p>
        <p>30–40% fewer warm leads walking through the door already trusting you.</p>
        <p>
          Every review you capture makes your job easier next month—because it brings more warm leads into your
          pipeline.

      <h2 class="section-header">The 4-Step System to Capture Reviews (Without Being Pushy)</h2>

      <p>Okay, so reviews matter. But how do you actually get them—without annoying the customer or feeling awkward?</p>

      <p>Here's the proven 4-step process.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 1: Plant the Seed Early (During the Sale)</h3>

      <p>
        Don't surprise the customer with a review request after the job is done. Set the expectation early—during your
        consultation—so they know it's coming.
      </p>

      <p>Here's the script:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "By the way, one of the ways we've grown is through word of mouth and online reviews. If we do a great job for
          you—and I'm confident we will—I'll ask you to leave us a quick review on Google. Fair enough?"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Why this works:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>It frames the review request as conditional on great service (which builds confidence).</li>
        <li>It removes the surprise factor. The customer already agreed to it.</li>
        <li>It positions your company as successful and review-driven (social proof).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Time investment: 10 seconds.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 2: Make the Post-Installation Call (24–48 Hours After the Job)</h3>

      <p>This is the most important step—and the one most salespeople skip.</p>

      <p>Here's why it matters:</p>

      <p>
        Not all unhappy customers complain. Some will smile, say everything's fine, and then quietly decide never to
        refer you—or worse, leave a bad review months later.
      </p>

      <p>
        We call this "Silent Death." The customer who doesn't complain, but also doesn't come back or recommend you.
      </p>

      <p>The post-installation call prevents Silent Death.</p>

      <p>
        When you call 24–48 hours after the job is done, you're giving the customer a chance to tell you about any small
        issues (a crooked transition strip, a spot that needs touch-up) while they're still easy to fix.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of it like a punch list in construction. You catch the little stuff, fix it fast, and the customer is
        thrilled you cared enough to check.
      </p>

      <p>This is the difference between a punch list and a problem:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>A punch list is a small issue you catch early and fix fast. The customer appreciates it.</li>
        <li>A problem is the same issue, ignored, that festers and turns into a bad review or lost referral.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here's the script:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm just calling to check in and make sure everything
          went smoothly with your installation. How's the floor looking? Any questions or concerns I can help with?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>If everything's great:</strong></p>
        <p>
          "That's great to hear! I'm so glad we could take care of you. Now, I know you're probably busy, but if you
          have a minute this week, I'd really appreciate it if you could leave us a quick review on Google. It helps us
          out a ton and helps other people feel confident choosing us. I'm going to text you a link right now so it's
          easy—does that work?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>If there's an issue:</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Thanks so much for letting me know. I'm going to get that taken care of right away. Let me call you back once
          it's fixed, and then I'll send you that review link. Sound good?"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Why this works:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>
          You're demonstrating that you care about quality and follow-through (which makes them want to leave a good
          review).
        </li>
        <li>You're catching issues early, before they escalate.</li>
        <li>You're asking for the review while the positive experience is still fresh.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Time investment: 2 minutes per call.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 3: Text the Link Immediately (While You're Still on the Phone)</h3>

      <p>Don't wait. Don't say, "I'll send it later." Send it while you're talking to them.</p>

      <p>Here's the text template:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], thanks again for choosing us! Here's the link to leave your review: [Google Review Link].
          It'll only take a minute, and it really helps us out. We appreciate you!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>Alternative version (with "pay it forward" framing):</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], thanks again for trusting us with your project! If you have a minute, we'd love it if you
          could leave us a quick Google review. When you do, you're helping the next family who's trying to decide where
          to go—kind of like paying it forward. Here's the link: [Google Review Link]. We really appreciate you!"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Why this works:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>The link is in their hand. There's no friction.</li>
        <li>They can do it right now if they want, or later when they have time.</li>
        <li>You're framing it as helping future customers, not just helping you.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Time investment: 30 seconds.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 4: Follow Up (3–5 Days Later if They Haven't Left a Review)</h3>

      <p>Life gets busy. People forget. A friendly follow-up reminder is not pushy—it's helpful.</p>

      <p>Here's the follow-up text:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], just checking in—did the link I sent work okay? I know things get busy, but if you get a
          chance, we'd love that review! Here's the link again: [link]. Let me know if you have any trouble with it.
          Thanks!"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Why this works:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>You're not saying, "Hey, you forgot." You're saying, "Did the link work?"</li>
        <li>It's a helpful, low-pressure nudge that often gets results.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Time investment: 30 seconds.</strong></p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Total Time Per Customer: 3 Minutes, 10 Seconds</div>
        <p>That's it. That's the system.</p>
        <p>If you do this consistently, you'll capture reviews from 40–60% of your customers.</p>
        <p>And here's the payoff:</p>
        <p>
          Every review you capture makes your job easier next month—because it brings more warm leads through the door.

      <h2 class="section-header">How to Use Reviews to Close More Sales</h2>

      <p>Capturing reviews is only half the system. The other half is using them to close more deals.</p>

      <p>Here's how.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #1: Ask "How Did You Hear About Us?" (And Use Their Answer)</h3>

      <p>When a customer walks in or calls, ask:</p>

      <p>"How did you hear about us?"</p>

      <p>If they say, "I found you on Google" or "I read your reviews," call it out:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "That's great! Yeah, we're really proud of our reviews. We work hard to take care of every customer, and it's
          nice to know people feel good enough about us to share their experience. We'll take great care of you too."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why this works: You're reinforcing their decision to choose you. They already trust you—now you're validating
        that trust.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #2: Send Curated Reviews in Follow-Up Emails</h3>

      <p>
        After your initial consultation, send a follow-up email that includes 2–3 reviews that match the customer's
        specific concerns.
      </p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>If they're worried about price, send a review that talks about value and affordability.</li>
        <li>If they're concerned about installation quality, send a review that praises your installers.</li>
        <li>If they're nervous about the process, send a review that talks about how easy and stress-free it was.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>How to do this:</strong> Ask your manager for the Review Catalog (a document that organizes your best
        reviews by theme). Then pull the 2–3 that are most relevant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't just paste the review text. Write a sentence like, "I thought you might like to
        see what other customers said about [their concern]."
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #3: Use Reviews to Handle Objections</h3>

      <p>When a customer says, "I'm getting quotes from a few other places," point them to your reviews.</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "That makes total sense—you want to make sure you're making the right choice. One thing I'd encourage you to
          do is compare our Google reviews to theirs. We've got over 200 five-star reviews, and people talk a lot about
          our quality, our installers, and how we handle any issues that come up. That's not something every company can
          say. You're not just buying a floor—you're buying peace of mind."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why this works: You're shifting the conversation from price to value. And reviews are third-party proof that
        backs up everything you're saying.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #4: Frame Risk (Because You Can't Resell a Floor)</h3>

      <p>Here's a line every customer needs to hear:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "You can't resell a floor. Once it's in, you're living with it for 10–15 years. So the real question isn't
          'Who's cheapest?' It's 'Who's going to do it right the first time and be there if something goes wrong?'
          That's where our reviews matter. People don't just talk about our product—they talk about our service, our
          follow-through, and how we treat them after the sale."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why this works: You're reframing the decision. It's not about saving $500 now. It's about avoiding a $5,000
        mistake later.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #5: Build Your Own "About Me" Sheet with Your Best Reviews</h3>

      <p>
        If customers mention you by name in a review, ask your manager to pull those reviews and create a simple
        one-page "About Me" sheet for you.
      </p>

      <p>What to include:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>Your name and photo</li>
        <li>
          A short intro (e.g., "I've been helping homeowners find the perfect flooring for 5 years, and I love making
          the process easy and stress-free.")
        </li>
        <li>3–5 reviews where customers mention you by name</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How to use it: Keep it on your desk or hand it to customers during consultations.</p>

      <p>
        Why this works: It builds credibility fast. Customers see that other people trusted you, liked working with you,
        and got great results.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Tactic #6: Use the Review Wall During Consultations</h3>

      <p>If your showroom has a review wall (physical or digital), use it during consultations.</p>

      <p>When you're walking a customer through samples, gesture to the wall and say:</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "By the way, if you want to see what other customers have said about us, we've got some of our best reviews
          right over there. People talk a lot about our installers and how clean and professional they are—that's
          something we're really proud of."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why this works: It's a soft, conversational way to reinforce trust. You're not forcing them to read
        reviews—you're just pointing out that they're there.

      <h2 class="section-header">How to Track the Impact on YOUR Commissions</h2>

      <p>Here's how to prove to yourself (and your manager) that reviews are making you more money.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 1: Ask Every Customer, "How Did You Hear About Us?"</h3>

      <p>Write it down. Track it in your CRM or a simple notebook.</p>

      <p>At the end of each month, count how many leads came from:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>Google / organic search</li>
        <li>Paid ads</li>
        <li>Referrals</li>
        <li>Walk-ins</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 2: Compare Your Close Rate on Google Leads vs. Other Sources</h3>

      <p>You'll probably notice that Google leads close faster and at higher tickets than paid ad leads.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p><strong>Google leads:</strong> 50% close rate, $8,000 average ticket</p>
        <p><strong>Paid ad leads:</strong> 25% close rate, $6,000 average ticket</p>
        <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Google leads are worth 2× as much to you.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Step 3: Calculate Your Monthly "Review Bonus"</h3>

      <p>Let's say you capture 10 reviews per month, and your company pays you $15 per review.</p>

      <p>That's an extra $150/month in your paycheck—just for making a 2-minute phone call and sending a text.</p>

      <p>Over a year, that's $1,800.</p>

      <p>And that doesn't even count the indirect benefit: more leads, warmer leads, and higher commissions.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Real Talk: This Adds Up Fast</div>
        <p>Let's say you're earning $60,000/year in base + commissions right now.</p>
        <p>
          If reviews increase your lead volume by 30% (and those leads are warmer and easier to close), your commissions
          could jump by $10,000–$15,000/year.
        </p>
        <p>Add the $1,800/year review bonus on top of that, and you're looking at an extra $12,000–$17,000/year.</p>
        <p>That's a car payment. That's a vacation. That's real money.</p>
        <p>And all it costs you is 3 minutes 10 seconds per customer.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Common Objections (And How to Handle Them)</h2>

      <p>Let's address the concerns you might have about asking for reviews.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Objection #1: "I don't want to be pushy."</h3>

      <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

      <p>
        You're not being pushy. You're giving the customer an opportunity to help the next family who's trying to decide
        where to go.
      </p>

      <p>Frame it as "paying it forward," not begging for a favor.</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "When you leave a review, you're not doing me a favor—you're helping the next family who's trying to decide
          where to go. You're basically paying it forward. That's not pushy. That's generous."
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Objection #2: "What if they leave a bad review?"</h3>

      <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

      <p>
        If you're making the post-installation call (Step 2), you're catching problems early—before they turn into bad
        reviews.
      </p>

      <p>And here's the reality: Most customers are happy. They just haven't been asked to leave a review yet.</p>

      <p>Bottom line: The post-installation call is your insurance policy against bad reviews.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Objection #3: "I'm too busy."</h3>

      <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

      <p>The post-installation call takes 2 minutes. The text takes 30 seconds.</p>

      <p>If you're too busy to spend 3 minutes capturing a review, you're too busy to make more money.</p>

      <p>Because every review you capture brings you more warm leads next month.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Objection #4: "What if they say no?"</h3>

      <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

      <p>Most customers won't say no. And if they do, it's not personal.</p>

      <p>
        Here's the reality: You'll get more "yeses" than "nos." And every "yes" brings you one step closer to more
        leads, easier sales, and higher commissions.

        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Track how many times you say it. Goal: 100% of your consultations.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Week 2: Make the Post-Install Call</h3>

      <p>For every job that wraps up this week, make the post-install call within 24–48 hours.</p>

      <p>Use the script. Text the link immediately.</p>

      <p>Track how many calls you make and how many reviews you capture.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Week 3: Follow Up</h3>

      <p>
        For any customer who didn't leave a review yet, send the follow-up text 3–5 days after the original request.

      <p>Track how many follow-ups you send and how many reviews you capture.</p>

      <p>Here's the truth:</p>

      <p>Most salespeople treat reviews as something the company cares about—not something they care about.</p>

      <p>But the best salespeople understand that reviews are a leverage tool.</p>

      <p>Every review you capture:</p>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>Brings you more warm leads next month</li>
        <li>Makes your sales conversations easier</li>
        <li>Increases your commissions</li>
        <li>Builds your personal brand</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And over time, those reviews compound.</p>

      <p>In six months, you'll have a personal portfolio of glowing reviews that mention you by name.</p>

      <p>
        In a year, you'll be the go-to salesperson in your company because your leads close faster and your customers
        rave about you.
      </p>

      <p>In two years, you'll have a reputation that follows you wherever you go.</p>

      <p>That's the power of making reviews part of your process.</p>
