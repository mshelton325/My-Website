      <h1 class="cover-title">REVIEW CAPTURE SCRIPTS – MANAGER EDITION</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h2 class="section-header">Introduction for Managers</h2>

      <p>This document contains two critical parts:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Part 1:</strong> The exact customer-facing scripts your team should use to capture Google reviews at
        every stage of the customer journey (Scripts 1–7). These are the same scripts your salespeople will receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Part 2:</strong> Internal team management scripts and rollout guidance (Script 8 + implementation plan).
        This section is for managers only—do not distribute it to your sales team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why keep them separate? Because your salespeople need clear, confident scripts they can trust and use. They
        don't need to see you preparing for their objections in advance—that undermines trust and makes the system feel
        top-down instead of collaborative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use Part 1 to train your team. Use Part 2 to coach resisters, troubleshoot adoption challenges, and hold people
        accountable.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-header">PART 1: CUSTOMER-FACING SCRIPTS</h2>
      <p><em>(Scripts 1–7: These are the same scripts your sales team will receive)</em></p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 1: Planting the Seed (During the Initial Consultation)</h3>

      <p><strong>When to use:</strong> During or at the end of the sales consultation, before the customer signs.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Set the expectation that you'll ask for a review later—so it's not a surprise.</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        "By the way, one of the ways we've grown is through word of mouth and online reviews. If we do a great job for
        you—and I'm confident we will—I'll ask you to leave us a quick review on Google. Fair enough?"
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Why this works:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>It's conditional ("if we do a great job"), which builds confidence.</li>
          <li>It removes the surprise factor—the customer already agreed.</li>
          <li>It positions your company as successful and review-driven (social proof).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 10 seconds.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 2: The Post-Installation Call (24–48 Hours After the Job)</h3>

      <p><strong>When to use:</strong> 24–48 hours after installation is complete.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Check for "Silent Death" issues (small problems the customer hasn't reported), fix
        them fast, and ask for the review while the positive experience is fresh.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Script (If Everything Went Well):</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm just calling to check in and make sure everything
          went smoothly with your installation. How's the floor looking? Any questions or concerns I can help with?"
        </p>
        <p><em>[Customer says everything's great]</em></p>
        <p>
          "That's great to hear! I'm so glad we could take care of you. Now, I know you're probably busy, but if you
          have a minute this week, I'd REALLY appreciate it if you could leave us a quick review on Google. It helps us
          out a ton and helps other people feel confident choosing us. I'm going to text you a link right now so it's
          easy—does that work?"
        </p>
        <p><em>[Customer agrees]</em></p>
        <p>"Perfect! You'll see the text in just a second. Thanks so much—we really appreciate you!"</p>
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Script (If There's a Small Issue):</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm just calling to check in and make sure everything
          went smoothly with your installation. How's the floor looking? Any questions or concerns I can help with?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>[Customer mentions a small issue—e.g., a transition strip is crooked, a spot needs touch-up, etc.]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks so much for letting me know. I really appreciate you telling me—that's exactly the kind of thing I
          want to catch early. I'm going to get that taken care of right away. Let me call you back once it's fixed, and
          then I'll send you that review link. Sound good?"
        </p>
        <p><em>[Fix the issue, then call back]</em></p>
        <p>
          "Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] again. Just wanted to let you know we took care of that [issue].
          Everything should be perfect now. If you're happy with how we handled it, I'd love it if you could leave us a
          quick review on Google. I'm going to text you the link right now. Does that work?"
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Why this works:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            You're demonstrating that you care about quality and follow-through (which makes them want to leave a good
            review).
          </li>
          <li>You're catching issues early, before they escalate into bad reviews.</li>
          <li>You're asking for the review while the positive experience is still fresh.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 2 minutes per call.</p>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 3: The Text Message (Sent Immediately After the Call)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>When to use:</strong> Immediately after the post-installation call, while you're still on the phone or
        right after you hang up.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Get the review link into the customer's hands so there's no friction.</p>

      <h4><strong>Text Template (Standard Version):</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        "Hi [Customer Name], thanks again for choosing us! Here's the link to leave your review: [Google Review Link].
        It'll only take a minute, and it really helps us out. We appreciate you!"
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Text Template (Pay It Forward Version):</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        "Hi [Customer Name], thanks again for trusting us with your project! If you have a minute, we'd love it if you
        could leave us a quick Google review. When you do, you're helping the next family who's trying to decide where
        to go—kind of like paying it forward. Here's the link: [Google Review Link]. We really appreciate you!"

          <li>They can do it right now if they want, or later when they have time.</li>
          <li>The "pay it forward" framing makes it feel altruistic, not transactional.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 30 seconds.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 4: The Follow-Up Text (3–5 Days Later)</h3>

      <p><strong>When to use:</strong> If the customer hasn't left a review within 3–5 days of your initial text.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Give them a gentle, helpful reminder.</p>

      <div class="script-box">
        "Hi [Customer Name], just checking in—did the link I sent work okay? I know things get busy, but if you get a
        chance, we'd love that review! Here's the link again: [Google Review Link]. Let me know if you have any trouble
        with it. Thanks!"

          <li>It's a helpful, low-pressure nudge that often gets results.</li>
          <li>The actionable question ("did the link work?") prompts a response and reduces customer guilt.</li>

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 5: Handling Customer Objections</h3>

      <p>Sometimes customers will hesitate or push back. Here's how to handle the most common objections.</p>

      <h4><strong>Objection #1: "I don't really do reviews."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Response:</div>
        "I totally understand—not everyone does. But I'll tell you, it really does help us out. And it also helps the
        next family who's trying to decide where to go—kind of like paying it forward. If you have a minute, I'd really
        appreciate it. No pressure, though!"
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Objection #2: "I'll do it later."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Response:</div>
        "That's great, thank you! I'm going to text you the link right now so you have it whenever you're ready. It only
        takes about 60 seconds. Thanks so much!"
        <p><em>[Send the text immediately. Then follow up 3–5 days later if they don't leave the review.]</em></p>
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Objection #3: "I'm not tech-savvy / I don't know how."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Response:</div>
        "No problem at all! It's really easy—I'll text you a link, and all you have to do is click it, rate us with
        stars, and write a sentence or two about your experience. If you have any trouble, just call me back and I'll
        walk you through it. Sound good?"
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Objection #4: "What if something goes wrong later?"</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Response:</div>
        "That's exactly why I'm calling you now—to make sure everything's perfect before we ask for a review. If
        anything comes up later, you can always call us and we'll take care of it. That's part of our commitment to you.
        But if everything looks good right now, I'd love it if you could leave us a review. Does that sound fair?"
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Objection #5: "I already recommended you to my neighbor."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Response:</div>
        "That's awesome—thank you so much! And honestly, an online review is kind of like recommending us to a hundred

        appreciate it!"

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 6: Asking in Person (If the Customer Comes Back to Your Showroom)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>When to use:</strong> If the customer stops by your showroom after the job is done (to pick up leftover
        materials, ask a question, etc.).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ask for the review face-to-face.</p>

      <p><em>(For Managers Only – Do Not Distribute to Sales Team)</em></p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">SCRIPT 8: Handling Internal Team Objections</h3>

      <p>
        Sometimes your team will push back on asking for reviews. Here's how to handle the three most common
        objections—with data, logic, and real-world framing that connects the review system to their paycheck and job
        satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>When to use these scripts:</strong> In one-on-one coaching conversations, team meetings (when someone
        voices resistance publicly), or when you're rolling out the system for the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tone:</strong> Direct, empathetic, but firm. You're not asking for permission—you're explaining why this
        matters and holding them accountable.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Objection #1: "I don't want to be pushy."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Manager Response:</div>
        <p>
          "I get it. And here's the thing: you're not being pushy. You're giving the customer an opportunity to help the
          next family who's trying to decide where to go. That's not pushy—that's generous.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the reality: if we don't ask, we don't get. And if we don't get reviews, we spend more money on
          ads—which means less money for raises, bonuses, and benefits. So asking for reviews isn't just good for the
          company—it's good for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one more thing: you're already doing great work. The review is just the customer telling other people what
          you already know—that we did a great job. You're not asking them to lie. You're asking them to share the
          truth. That's not pushy. That's confidence."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Why this works:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>You're reframing "pushy" as "generous" and "confident."</li>
          <li>You're connecting reviews to their paycheck (raises, bonuses, benefits).</li>
          <li>You're reminding them that they're asking customers to share the truth, not exaggerate.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Objection #2: "What if they leave a bad review?"</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Manager Response:</div>
        <p>
          "That's exactly why we make the post-installation call—to catch problems early and fix them before they turn
          into bad reviews. If you're calling every customer 24–48 hours after the job, you're going to catch 95% of
          issues while they're still easy to fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if someone does leave a bad review, we'll respond professionally and make it right. But the best defense
          against bad reviews is volume—and that's what this system builds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the truth: right now, unhappy customers are already leaving bad reviews—we're just not asking the happy
          ones to leave good reviews. So we're fighting with one hand tied behind our back. This system fixes that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one more thing: if you're worried about bad reviews, that tells me you care about quality—which is exactly
          the kind of person I want on this team. So let's use that energy to make sure we're delivering great work and
          capturing great reviews."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Why this works:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            You're addressing the fear head-on with a logical process (post-installation calls catch issues early).
          </li>
          <li>You're reframing the fear as a quality-control strength.</li>
          <li>You're explaining that volume of good reviews is the best defense against occasional bad ones.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="page-number">Page 6</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h4><strong>Objection #3: "I'm too busy."</strong></h4>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Manager Response:</div>
        <p>
          "I hear you. But here's the thing: the post-installation call takes 2 minutes. The text takes 30 seconds.
          That's less time than it takes to follow up on a cold lead three times.
        </p>
        <p>
          And every review you capture brings us more warm leads next month—which makes your job easier. So you're not
          too busy. You're investing 3 minutes now to save yourself hours later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the math: if you spend 3 minutes per customer asking for reviews, and we capture 40–60% of them, we'll
          triple our digital leads in 6 months. That means more warm leads, fewer cold calls, higher close rates, and
          bigger paychecks.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the question isn't 'Am I too busy?' The question is 'Do I want to keep grinding on cold leads, or do I want
          to invest 3 minutes per job to make my life easier?'
        </p>
        <p>
          And here's the reality: this isn't optional. This is part of the job now. Just like you call to confirm the
          install, you call to ask for the review. It's that simple."

            You're breaking down the time investment (3 minutes total) and comparing it to the time they already spend

          </li>
          <li>
            You're connecting the review system to their paycheck and job satisfaction (more warm leads, less cold
            calling).
          </li>

      <h3 class="sub-header">How to Roll Out These Scripts to Your Team</h3>

      <p>
        Rolling out a new system isn't just about handing people a script and saying "go do it." You need to create
        buy-in, train the process, hold people accountable, and celebrate wins. Here's your step-by-step rollout plan.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Step 1: The Kickoff Meeting (30–45 minutes)</strong></h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Explain why reviews matter, show the data, address objections proactively, and get verbal
        commitment from the team.
      </p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Meeting Agenda:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Start with the problem (5 minutes):</strong> "Right now, we're spending $X per month on ads to
            generate leads. But most of those leads are cold—they've never heard of us, they're shopping price, and
            they're skeptical. That makes your job harder."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Show the data (5 minutes):</strong> Share the three findings: digital leads tripled, 70% of phone
            calls came from Google Business Profile, 30–40% total lead growth during review-active months.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Explain the system (10 minutes):</strong> Walk through the 4-step process: plant the seed,
            post-installation call, text the link, follow-up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Address objections proactively (10 minutes):</strong> Use the responses from Script 8 to address the
            three big objections (pushy, bad reviews, too busy).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect it to their paycheck (5 minutes):</strong> "Here's what this means for you: more reviews =
            more warm leads = higher close rates = bigger paychecks."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get verbal commitment (5 minutes):</strong> Go around the room and get a verbal "yes" from each
            person.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="page-number">Page 7</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h4><strong>Step 2: Role-Play Training (30 minutes)</strong></h4>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Practice the scripts out loud so they feel natural and confident.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">How to run it:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>Pair people up (or do it as a group with you playing the customer).</li>
          <li>
            Have them practice each script 2–3 times: Script 1: Planting the seed, Script 2: Post-installation call
            (both versions), Script 5: Handling customer objections
          </li>
          <li>Give feedback on tone, pacing, and confidence.</li>
          <li>
            Encourage them to adjust the wording slightly to match their voice—but don't let them rewrite the whole
            script.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Key point:</strong> Role-playing feels awkward, but it's critical. If they don't practice out loud, they
        won't use the scripts in the field.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>Step 3: Build Accountability into the Process</strong></h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Make asking for reviews a non-negotiable part of the job—not an "extra" thing they might
        forget.
      </p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">How to do it:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Job Folder Accountability Stamp:</strong> Add a checklist stamp to every job folder with these
            items: ☐ Seed planted during consultation, ☐ Post-installation call made (date: ______), ☐ Review link
            texted (date: ______), ☐ Follow-up sent (if needed) (date: ______), ☐ Review captured? (Y/N)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weekly check-ins:</strong> In your weekly sales meetings, ask each salesperson: "How many
            post-installation calls did you make this week?" "How many review links did you send?" "How many reviews did
            you capture?"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Track it publicly:</strong> Use the Weekly Sales Meeting Dashboard Template to display each
            salesperson's review capture rate on a leaderboard.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4><strong>Step 4: Celebrate Wins Publicly</strong></h4>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create positive reinforcement and social proof that the system works.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">How to do it:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li>
            <strong>In team meetings:</strong> Read new reviews out loud and recognize the salesperson who captured
            them.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Break room wall:</strong> Print and post new reviews on a "Wall of Fame" in the break room.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bonuses/incentives:</strong> Consider a small bonus ($25–$50) for every review captured, or a bigger
            bonus for hitting monthly targets (e.g., "First person to 10 reviews this month gets $200").
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="page-number">Page 8</div>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
      <h4><strong>Step 5: Coach the Resisters One-on-One</strong></h4>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Address individual objections privately and hold people accountable.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>When to do it:</strong> If someone consistently skips the post-installation call or doesn't send review
        links, pull them aside for a one-on-one conversation.
      </p>

      <div class="script-box">
        <div class="callout-header">What to say:</div>
        <p>"Hey [Name], I noticed you didn't make post-installation calls on your last three jobs. What's going on?"</p>
        <p><em>[Listen to their objection—usually one of the three from Script 8.]</em></p>
        <p><em>[Use the appropriate response from Script 8 to address it.]</em></p>
        <p>
          "Here's the deal: this is part of the job now. It's not optional. Just like you confirm the install, you make
          the post-installation call. I need you on board with this. Can I count on you to do it moving forward?"
        </p>
        <p><em>[Get a verbal commitment.]</em></p>
        <p>"Great. I'm going to check in with you next week to see how it's going."</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Be direct, empathetic, but firm. Don't let resisters drag the team down.</p>

      <h4><strong>Step 6: Track and Report Results</strong></h4>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Show the team that the system is working—and that their effort is paying off.</p>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">What to track:</div>
        <ul class="benefits-list">

          <li>Number of reviews captured per week</li>
          <li>Overall review count and average star rating</li>
          <li>Lead volume from Google Business Profile (track in your CRM or spreadsheet)</li>

          </li>
          <li>Post results on the break room wall or leaderboard.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> When people see that their effort is working, they'll keep doing it.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-header">Pro Tips for Managers</h3>

      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Lead by example.</strong> If you're not making post-installation calls and asking for reviews, your
          team won't either.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</strong> If someone uses the script and tweaks the wording
          slightly, that's fine—as long as they're asking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Address resistance early.</strong> If someone pushes back in a team meeting, address it immediately
          (using Script 8). Don't let it fester.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celebrate small wins.</strong> Every review matters. Make a big deal out of each one, especially in
          the first 30 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be patient but firm.</strong> It takes 30–60 days for the system to become a habit. Hold people
          accountable, but give them time to adjust.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        These scripts work. The system works. Your job is to train it, reinforce it, hold people accountable, and
        celebrate wins.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do that consistently for 90 days, you'll capture 40–60% of your customers as reviewers—and you'll see the
        results in your lead volume, close rates, and bottom line.
